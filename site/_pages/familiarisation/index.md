# Familiarisation

This page is to help you get familiarised with the rating interface for this test.

You can click the buttons to play the corresponding stimuli. The **Reference vocals** corresponds to the perfectly extracted vocals track. The **Original Mix** corresponds to the original song, included additionally to help you with rating.

You can listen to any of the presented stimuli as many times as you like. Move the buttons on the sliders to rate the perceived similarity to the **Reference vocals**. The stimulus will be looping until you play another one or click the **Stop Audio** button. The **Sort** button automatically sorts the stimuli based on the scores you gave them so far. It can be useful if you would like to check how you rated the stimuli before you proceed to the next page. Please note that you can only proceed after listening to all of the stimuli on the page by clicking the corresponding buttons.

Please grade the stimuli in terms of the **overall similarity** to the reference vocals.
