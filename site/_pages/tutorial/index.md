# Tutorial

This tutorial page is to help you better understand what you are asked about and what to expect during the test.

You are asked to evaluate the performance of source separation algorithms that attempt to separate the vocal from a mixture. The ideal result would be if the algorithm could perfectly extract the **Reference vocals**, so you are asked to rate how similar each test item is to this idea. The **Original mix** is also included to help guide your judgement, but it is the **Reference vocals** that you are asked to compare with, not the **Original mix**. In other words, the highest-rated stimulus should sound as close as possible to the **Reference vocals** track only.

Here you can listen to some audio samples with the types of degradation presented during the listening test. The **Reference vocals** example corresponds to the vocal track that contributes to the **Original mix**.

The degradation can be in terms of:

- Distortion in the target (vocals) sound
  - perception of parts of the target sound removed
  - timbral changes (e.g., brighter/duller)
  - spatial changes (e.g., shifting/fluctuating)
- Unwanted sound in addition to the target
  - presence of other tracks from the mix
  - presence of unknown sounds (e.g., noises, “birdies”)

There is no defined order of importance of these aspects for your similarity judgement, and you are free to base your decisions on any or all combination of these. Please note again that the presence of other tracks, clean or distorted, is considered as degradation in this test. For example, the **Original mix**, although it contains the **Reference vocals**, may be considered to be dissimilar to the **Reference vocals** due to the presence of the other parts of the mix.
