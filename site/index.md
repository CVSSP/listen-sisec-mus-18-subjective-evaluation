# Perceptual Evaluation of Source Separation Algorithms

Thank you for taking part in the listening test.

The "next" button will take you to the tutorial and familiarisation pages, where you can listen to various samples of the stimuli, and then to the actual test pages, where you are asked to grade the stimuli based on the **overall similarity** to the original vocal sound.

Please feel free to pause at any time if you have any question or need any assistance in taking the test.
